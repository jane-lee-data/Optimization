A hospital is relocating to a larger hospital with five operating rooms. Relocation will increase weekly operating hours from 190 to 213.5 hours. The task is to create a new schedule for six departments that allocate slots in an equitable way. 'Equitable' here means each department maintaining the current share (%) of operating hours and minimize total underallocation (%) of each department to operating rooms.
